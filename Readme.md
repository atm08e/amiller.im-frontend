## Synopsis

This project is the frontend for my personal blog/website served by amiller-python backend. It displays blog posts, snowboarding trip pictures, fishing pictures, and my music taste. Pull requests welcome! :)


## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with nodejs ecosystem and react framework.


## Installation

There is a makefile and run.sh script included to get you going. But they are not needed if you are already familiar with nodejs projects. Simply do an npm install && ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js serve
